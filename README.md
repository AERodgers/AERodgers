- 👋 Hi, I’m @AERodgers
- 👀 I’m interested in phonetics in general -- in particular, acoustic phonetics, speech prosody, intonation, dialects of English in Ireland, and teaching methodologies (for phonetics, ESOL, and academic skills)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about R and statistical analysis.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects to develop:
  
    - Accessible speech analysis and data representation plug-ins for Praat
    - Strategies for learning and teaching  intonation in a second or other language
    - Resources for ear-training, IPA transcription practice, etc (especially for future SLTs).
  
- 📫 How to reach me: by email or twitter or even snailmail if you're feeling old skool!
